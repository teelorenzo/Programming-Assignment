# Programming-Assignment
Directions  Pick a project idea from the My last Python project discussion board. Since not all students had a Python class previously, I want to be equitable and just let everyone pick what they want to do from the list. Feel free to ask further questions about the project idea from the original poster by replying on the discussion board.
