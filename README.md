# Programming-Assignment
Directions  Pick a project idea from the My last Python project discussion board. Since not all students had a Python class previously, I want to be equitable and just let everyone pick what they want to do from the list. Feel free to ask further questions about the project idea from the original poster by replying on the discussion board. 
# Project proposal
For this assignment, I decided to go with a TV Remote Control Simulation in Java. I previously completed a similar program in Python for my Computer Science 2 class, which included a GUI. Since I haven’t learned Java GUIs yet, I’m open to trying them, but if that doesn’t work out, I’ll stick with a text-based menu instead. The program will run in a loop, allowing users to enter numbers to choose different options, such as adjusting the volume or changing channels. The goal is to create a simple program that functions like a real TV remote, letting users turn the TV on and off, control the volume, and switch channels. I also plan to add a TV guide feature with preset channels (e.g., Cartoon Network, CNN, MSNBC, ABC). Additionally, the program will log each session, keeping track of when the TV is turned on and what actions are performed until it is turned off. My aim is to make the remote simulation feel realistic but make it simple to use.
